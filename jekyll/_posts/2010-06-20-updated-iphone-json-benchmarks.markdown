**Update:** You can see the latest benchmarks at <https://github.com/samsoffes/json-benchmarks>. The results change quite a bit, so I'd recommend just running the code and seeing who wins.

I wrote [a post awhile ago about JSON benchmarks](http://samsoff.es/posts/iphone-json-benchmarks). I was telling [a friend](http://twitter.com/lukeredpath) he should use [JSON Framework][] based on my old benchmark post. He asked if I had run them again recently, so I figured I'd run them again.

I [updated my test app](http://github.com/samsoffes/json-benchmarks/commit/18ec5f34a46b8c973aa301fe738753ce52c12f4d) and added a new library called [YAJL][] based on a [C library](http://lloyd.github.com/yajl/). My results were very similar to before. This time I tested it on an iPad and iPod Touch.

### Results

On both devices, they ranked [Apple JSON][], [YAJL][], [JSON Framework][], and [TouchJSON][]. You can read the detailed results [on GitHub](http://github.com/samsoffes/json-benchmarks/blob/18ec5f34a46b8c973aa301fe738753ce52c12f4d/Readme.markdown).

In conclusion, *it looks like [YAJL][] is the new one to use*. Again, feel free to [check out my code on GitHub](http://github.com/samsoffes/json-benchmarks).
