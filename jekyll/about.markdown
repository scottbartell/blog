I am a [iOS and Rails software engineer](http://github.com/samsoffes), [musician](http://samsoff.es/music), [wanna be designer](http://dribbble.com/samsoffes), and burger connoisseur. I live in San Francisco. I work at [Synthetic](http://heysynthetic.com) (the makes of [Hipstamatic](http://hipstamatic.com)).

I [make my own music](http://samsoff.es/music) sometimes. I'm also in a band called [Finding Chesterfield](http://findingchesterfield.com). I am always in constant pursuit of tasting the perfect burger. So far, the best one I have ever had was at [The Grape in Dallas, TX](http://gowalla.com/spots/63115). It blew my face off with awesome.

Recently some of my work I did for a client was featured in [The New York Times](http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/11/11/social-books-hopes-to-make-e-reading-communal/) and [Tech Crunch](http://techcrunch.com/2010/11/11/rethink-books-social/). A few years ago, I wrote this app for the iPhone called [Bible](http://youversion.com/iphone) that launched day one of the App Store. There are well over 10 million people using it now, so that's pretty cool. I used to own a few companies, freelanced, and worked at some startups. I can tell you all about it if you're curious.
  
You can [download my résumé](http://samsoff.es/resume) if you want. I'm not actively looking for a job or side projects, but feel free to get in touch anyway. <span class="gray">(If you are a third-party recruiter, please don't contact me about employment opportunities. Thanks.)</span>
