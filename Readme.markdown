# samsoff.es

This is my personal blog currently using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/). (It used to be [written in Rails](http://github.com/samsoffes/samsoff.es/tree/rails).)

Feel free to rip as much of this off as you want (with the exception of the blog posts).

## Running Locally

Get the code and install the necessary gems:

    $ git clone https://github.com/samsoffes/samsoff.es.git
    $ cd samsoff.es
    $ bundle install

Then to compile everything and start the local server, simply run:

    $ rake server
